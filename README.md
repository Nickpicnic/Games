JS Games

A simple 2D browser game. 
The rules are pretty simple: 
  - you have to run away from monsters
  - you also have to collect all the coins (the # of coins is shown at the bottom of the screen)
  - if a monster catches you - you die, but if you collect all the coins the golden stairs will appear at the center of the 
    map. Get there to reach the next level.
    
  - You can also create your own levels, modify the existing ones or even create new campaigns from levels that you like.
